#this data anlasys provides a comprehensive view of 15 high schools, including their school type, total students, budget, and performance metrics such as average math and reading scores, as well as the percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall.
From the summary tables we have created, we can analyes the following:

###1.There are two types of schools in the dataset: Charter and District. Charter schools tend to have fewer students than District schools.

###2.The total school budget varies across schools, with some schools having a budget exceeding $3 million, while others have less than $1 million. The per-student budget ranges from $578 to $655, with schools grouped into four spending ranges: <$585, $585-630, $630-645, and $645-680.

###3.The average math scores range from approximately 76 to 83, while the average reading scores are between 80 and 84. In general, Charter schools have higher average scores in both math and reading than District schools.

###4.The percentage of students passing math ranges from 65% to 94%, and the percentage passing reading varies from 80% to 97%. Charter schools generally have a higher percentage of students passing both math and reading.

###5. The overall passing percentage,ranges from 52% to 91%. Charter schools consistently outperform District schools in overall passing percentage.

#In conclusion, the data shows that Charter schools generally perform better in terms of average test scores and passing percentages compared to District schools. Additionally, smaller school sizes and lower per-student spending ranges are associated with higher performance metrics.
